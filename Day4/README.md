# List Comprehension

You are given three integers x,y,z and representing the dimensions of a cuboid
along with an integer n. Print a list of all possible coordinates given by on a 3D grid where the sum of x,y,z
is not equal to n.

## Example

x = 1

y = 1

z = 1

n = 3


All permutations of [i,j,k] are:

[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1]]


Print an array of the elements that do not sum to n = 3.

[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1]]
